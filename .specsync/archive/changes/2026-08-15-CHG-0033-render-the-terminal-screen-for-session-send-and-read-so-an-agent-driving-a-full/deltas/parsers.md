### SPEC SECTION Public API
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `TableParser` | class | Class method `.parse(text, format: :auto)` converts space or pipe-delimited table text into array of hashes. `format:` accepts `:auto` (default heuristic), `:pipe`, or `:space` to force a parsing mode; raises `ArgumentError` for any other value. |
| `KeyValueParser` | class | Class method `.parse(text)` converts key-value text lines (`key: val`) into typed hashes. |
| `TextSanitizer` | class | Class method `.strip_ansi(text)` strips ANSI escape codes and normalizes line endings. |
| `ScreenRenderer` | class | Class method `.render(text, rows:, columns:, tail_bytes:)` replays a terminal byte stream onto a virtual screen and returns what a terminal would be showing. |
| `PromptDetector` | class | Class method `.detect?(line)` reports whether a single line of (possibly ANSI-colored) output looks like an interactive prompt awaiting input — used by `PTYRunner`/`PTYWatcher` to set `prompt_detected` in their results. |
| `Rune` | module | Top-level rune namespace. |
| `Parsers` | module | Namespace for terminal-output parsing helpers. |
| `parse` | class method | Parses the supplied text using the parser's documented format contract. |
| `parse_pipe_table` | internal method | Builds rows from pipe-delimited headers and cells. |
| `parse_space_table` | internal method | Builds rows from aligned whitespace-delimited columns. |
| `find_headers_and_spans` | internal method | Derives normalized headers and source-column spans. |
| `multi_space_spans` | internal method | Computes spans for headers separated by two or more spaces. |
| `single_space_spans` | internal method | Computes fallback spans from individual non-space tokens. |
| `set_span_ends` | internal method | Completes each detected column span using the following start offset. |
| `extract_values` | internal method | Selects split-based or span-based value extraction for a row. |
| `extract_by_spans` | internal method | Slices row values according to detected header positions. |
| `normalize_header` | internal method | Converts a header to a lowercase underscored symbol. |
| `build_row` | internal method | Zips normalized headers with values, filling missing cells with empty strings. |
| `strip_ansi` | class method | Removes supported ANSI sequences and normalizes CRLF/CR line endings. |
| `ANSI_REGEX` | constant | Escape-sequence pattern removed by `TextSanitizer`. |
| `render` | class method | Replays a byte stream onto a virtual screen and returns the visible text. |
| `Screen` | class | The grid and cursor a terminal maintains, separated from escape-sequence parsing. |
| `write` | instance method | Writes characters at the cursor, wrapping at the right margin. |
| `to_s` | instance method | Returns the visible screen, right-trimmed with trailing blank lines removed. |
| `DEFAULT_ROWS` | constant | Rows assumed when no size is given. |
| `DEFAULT_COLUMNS` | constant | Columns assumed when no size is given. |
| `DEFAULT_TAIL_BYTES` | constant | How much of a transcript tail is replayed, bounding work for a long session. |
| `TAB_WIDTH` | constant | Columns between tab stops. |
| `PRINTABLE` | constant | Pattern for bytes the renderer writes rather than interprets. |
| `CONTROLS` | constant | CSI final byte to the screen operation it performs. |
| `detect?` | class method | Reports whether a cleaned line resembles a supported interactive prompt. |
| `PROMPT_PATTERNS` | constant | Positive prompt-detection patterns. |
| `FALSE_POSITIVES` | constant | Exclusions applied before positive prompt matching. |

### SPEC SECTION Invariants

1. `TableParser.parse` converts header titles to lowercase underscored symbols.
2. `KeyValueParser.parse` coerces integer, float, and boolean values automatically.
3. `TextSanitizer.strip_ansi` returns an empty string for nil input.
4. `TableParser.parse` with `format: :auto` (default) detects pipe vs. space tables by checking whether the header line contains `|`; `format: :pipe`/`:space` bypass detection entirely.
5. `TableParser.parse` raises `ArgumentError` for an unrecognized `format:` value regardless of
   input size — validated unconditionally, not only once the input has 2+ non-empty lines.
6. `PromptDetector.detect?` strips ANSI codes before matching, and returns `false` (never raises)
   for `nil`, empty, or whitespace-only input.
7. `PromptDetector.detect?` recognizes explicit confirmations, labeled prompts, anchored
   interactive-wizard markers, arrow prompts, and recognizable shell prompts
   (`user@host:path$`, macOS-style `user@host cwd %`, optional `(venv)` prefixes, and named
   shells such as `bash-5.2#` / `zsh-5.9%`). Arbitrary prose questions and ordinary output
   ending in a bare `#`, `>`, `$`, or `%` are not sufficient evidence of a prompt. This
   intentionally favors rare false negatives over false positives that cause an agent to take an
   incorrect interactive branch.

8. `ScreenRenderer.render` obeys the escape sequences that decide where text lands — cursor
   motion, erasing, and line discipline — rather than deleting them as `TextSanitizer` does. This
   is the difference between every frame of a repaint and only the frame on screen: measured
   against grok, a 361KB transcript stripped to 36.9KB of escape-free text but rendered to 1.1KB,
   and an answer absent from the stripped text was present in the rendered screen.
9. `ScreenRenderer.render` never fails to consume input. Its scanner advances on every iteration,
   including for bytes it does not act on, because a scan loop that can match without consuming is
   a hang rather than a wrong answer.
10. `ScreenRenderer.render` returns an empty string for nil or empty input, tolerates invalid
    UTF-8, and bounds work by rendering only the tail of a long transcript.


### SPEC SECTION Known Limitations
- **Space-delimited heuristic is column-alignment dependent.** `TableParser`'s `:space` mode splits on runs of 2+ spaces (falling back to single-space token spans only when the header has one word). Cell values that don't align to the header's column boundaries, or that contain internal runs of 2+ spaces, can be misattributed to the wrong column. When source output is unreliable or known in advance, pass an explicit `format:` rather than relying on `:auto`.
- **`ScreenRenderer` is not a terminal emulator.** It implements what moves the cursor and what
  erases; it does not model scroll regions, alternate-screen buffers as separate grids, tab-stop
  changes, character sets, or double-width characters. A child that relies on those will render
  approximately. Colours and modes are consumed and discarded by design — they cannot move the
  cursor, so they cannot change which text is on screen.
- **A rendered screen shows the end state, not the history.** Anything the child scrolled or
  repainted away is gone, which is the point, but it means the screen is not a substitute for the
  transcript when the question is "what happened" rather than "what is displayed".
- **`:auto` detection is a single check.** It only inspects whether the header line contains `|` — free-text tables whose header happens to contain a literal pipe character will be misdetected as pipe tables unless `format: :space` is passed explicitly.
