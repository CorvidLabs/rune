### SPEC SECTION Public API

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `TableParser` | class | Class method `.parse(text, format: :auto)` converts space or pipe-delimited table text into array of hashes. `format:` accepts `:auto` (default heuristic), `:pipe`, or `:space` to force a parsing mode; raises `ArgumentError` for any other value. |
| `KeyValueParser` | class | Class method `.parse(text)` converts key-value text lines (`key: val`) into typed hashes. |
| `TextSanitizer` | class | Class method `.strip_ansi(text)` strips ANSI escape codes and normalizes line endings. |
| `ScreenRenderer` | class | Class method `.render(text, rows:, columns:, tail_bytes:)` replays a terminal byte stream onto a virtual screen and returns what a terminal would be showing. |
